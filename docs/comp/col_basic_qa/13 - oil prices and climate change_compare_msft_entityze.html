<span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">A few months ago</span> at the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">Paris climate talks</span>, <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">President Barack Obama</span> and a panoply of world leaders talked at length about the importance of reducing <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> pollution associated with burning <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal">coal</span>, the largest source of greenhouse <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas">gases</span>. So far there is <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">only one</span> way to do that without pulling the plug on <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal">coal</span> altogether: <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere">carbon capture and storage (CCS</span>), a process by which <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span><span class="text right"> is pulled from a smokestack before it escapes into the air and is then buried deep underground.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Nearly every plan to mitigate global warming includes </span><span class="entity E2A" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere">CCS</span>, yet few countries have adopted the technology because there is little incentive to make the costly investment. <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">Decades ago</span>, however, <span class="entity E3E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="sovereign state in North America">the U.S.</span> found a clever way to make the method economically viable: tie <span class="entity E2A" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere">CCS</span> to oil recovery. And while the scheme seemed to work, low oil prices now are putting <span class="entity E2A" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere">CCS</span><span class="text right">—and therefore almost all climate cleanup plans—in jeopardy.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Oil-field workers first pumped </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> down into oil wells in <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">1972</span>. Called <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="true when either but not both inputs are true">enhanced oil recovery (EOR</span>), the technique boosts the amount of <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">petroleum</span> that a well yields because the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas">gas</span> eases the flow of the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">oil</span>, restores pressure underground to force more <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">oil</span> to the surface, and slips into nooks and crannies that other aids, such as <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water">water</span>, will simply flow around. During the process, a portion of <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span> becomes trapped underground like the oil before it. “<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">It</span> will stay there for eternity,” says Richard Esposito, a geologist who has worked to develop <span class="entity E2A" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere">CCS</span> at the coal-burning electric utility <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Company">Southern Company</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">This arrangement—using </span><span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span> to get oil—is <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">one</span> of the few ways to make carbon capture pay, says Julio Friedmann, the principal deputy assistant secretary for fossil energy at the <span class="entity E3E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="sovereign state in North America">U.S.</span> Department of Energy. “<span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="true when either but not both inputs are true">EOR</span> has been the dominant storage mode because it produces revenue,” he explains. In other words, it potentially satisfies oil companies and environmentalists. With money to be made, a handful of <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="true when either but not both inputs are true">EOR</span> projects popped up across <span class="entity E3E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="sovereign state in North America">the U.S.</span> over <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">the past few decades</span>. For example, at the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinsley,_Mississippi">Tinsley</span> oil field in <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River">Mississippi</span>, the oil and natural gas company <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denbury_Resources">Denbury Resources</span> began flooding wells with <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span> in <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">March 2008</span> and now recycles some 670 million cubic feet (19 million cubic meters) of the gas <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">every day</span><span class="text right">—increasing its oil production from 50 barrels a day to more than 9,000 barrels a day.</span><br />
<span class="text left">In fact, </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denbury">Denbury</span> and several other companies using <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="true when either but not both inputs are true">EOR</span> need so much <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span> that they recently contracted to buy the pollution from a new coal-fired power plant in <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemper_County,_Mississippi">Kemper County</span>, Mississippi—the ultimate goal of the scheme. Such so-called anthropogenic <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span> now makes up <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">roughly a quarter</span> of all the <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span><span class="text right"> used for this type of oil recovery (the rest comes from natural deposits trapped in geologic domes).</span><br />
<span class="text left">The relationship between </span><span class="entity E2A" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere">CCS</span> and <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="true when either but not both inputs are true">EOR</span> is fragile, however. Because the price of <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">oil</span> has dipped so dramatically over <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">the past couple of years</span>, burying <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span> no longer pays. Plummeting prices have made it difficult for <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="true when either but not both inputs are true">EOR</span> companies to bring in enough money to pay for new machinery, such as pumps, compressors and specialized pipelines, says Dan Cole, <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denbury">Denbury</span>'s vice president of commercial development and governmental relations. Already oil-field services giant <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlumberger">Schlumberger</span> has shut down its <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon">Carbon</span> <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_services">Services</span> unit, which was supposed to turn <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span> into a steady business, and others are considering similar moves. Those closures could throw a wrench into the climate cleanup efforts carefully laid out in recent reports by the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency">International Energy Agency</span> and the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">At the same time, the troubled relationship may highlight the irony of crafting planet-saving scenarios that rely on oil extraction. After all, burning the extra </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">oil</span> produced by pumping <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> underground produces more <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span><span class="text right"> that ends up in the atmosphere, causing yet more global warming.</span><br />
<span class="text left">And there are alternative solutions to pay for </span><span class="entity E2A" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere">CCS</span>, although they are far from application. For example, one way to encourage burying <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="chemical compound">CO2</span> pollution directly is to provide a $<span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">50-per</span>-metric-ton tax credit for such sequestration, says the doe's Friedmann. He adds, “<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The</span> harsh mathematics of atmospheric accumulation make it clear that <span class="entity E2A" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere">CCS</span><span class="text right"> needs to be a climate solution.”</span>
