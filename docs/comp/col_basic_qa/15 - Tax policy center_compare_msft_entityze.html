<span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">This week</span>, the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Policy_Center">Tax Policy Center</span> — a well-regarded non-partisan think tank — issued a report saying that <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz">Ted Cruz</span>’s tax plan would cost the government <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">$8.6 trillion</span> over <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">the next 10 years</span>. Which is fine, except that back in <span class="entity DE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">October</span>, the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Foundation">Tax Foundation</span> — a well-regarded nonpartisan think tank — looked at the same plan and estimated it would cost <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">$768 billion</span>. Even in the world of federal budgets, an <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">$8 trillion</span><span class="text right"> gap is a lot of money.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Meanwhile, on the </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</span> side of the race, a fight broke out among economists over the likely impact of <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Bernie Sanders</span>’s tax and spending plans. <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician">Others</span> have covered the battle in more depth, but the short version is that <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Friedman_(economist)">Gerald Friedman</span>, a <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst">University of Massachusetts</span> economist who has consulted for the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> campaign,1 released a report estimating that <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span>’s proposals would create <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">millions</span> of new jobs, increase household incomes by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">tens of thousands of dollars</span> and boost the overall size of the economy by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">more than a third</span>. (<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The</span> <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> campaign has embraced <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Friedman_(economist)">Friedman</span>’s analysis. According to <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post">The Washington Post</span>’s Jim Tankersley, however, <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Friedman_(economist)">Friedman</span> is not planning on voting for <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span>.) <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economics">Mainstream</span> <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</span> economists responded by saying, more or less, “You’ve got to be kidding me”; former <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Obama administration</span> economic adviser <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee">Austan Goolsbee</span> likened the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> plan to “magic flying puppies with winning Lotto tickets tied to their collars.” <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Foundation">The Tax Foundation</span>, for its part, estimates the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> proposals would shrink the economy by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">nearly 10 percent</span><span class="text right"> over the long term.</span><br />
<span class="text left">If the supposed experts can’t even agree on the direction of a plan’s impact, is there any hope for a normal voter? Yes — but it helps to understand a few things about how experts reach these estimates, and why they differ so widely.</span><br />
<span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">First</span>, this <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">week</span>’s jumbled headlines notwithstanding, there is actually a lot that the experts do agree on. <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">The Republican</span> plans, especially <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</span>’s, would reduce federal revenues by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">trillions of dollars</span>. <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span>’s plan would increase both taxing and spending by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">trillions</span><span class="text right"> (the disagreement surrounds whether the new taxes would pay for all the new spending).</span><br />
<span class="text left">Second, most of the disagreement among experts is about the broader economic impact of the various plans, not the plans themselves. Here’s what I mean by that: Figuring out how much extra money a tweak to the tax code would bring in, or how much a new policy would cost, is relatively straightforward. This is what is known as “static” analysis — taken in isolation, how would these plans change things? </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics">Economists</span> can usually agree on an answer, or at least come close. (Emphasis on “usually.” Some proposals, such as <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span>’s single-payer health system or <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz">Cruz</span><span class="text right">’s value-added tax, are so dramatic that experts reach wildly different estimates of their impact.)</span><br />
<span class="text left">The trouble is, these plans don’t exist in isolation: Changes in tax policy have far-reaching ripple effects on the economy. In theory, there is little doubt that we should try to take such “dynamic effects” into account, but in practice there is often significant disagreement among economists about how exactly to do so. </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Foundation">The Tax Foundation</span>, which tends to lean to the right, thinks the tax increases that <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> is proposing will slow the economy, further reducing tax receipts (since there will be less money to tax) and making the revenue impact look larger than it would under a static model. <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Friedman_(economist)">Friedman</span>, at <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst">UMass</span>, thinks the extra government spending that <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span><span class="text right"> is proposing will speed up the economy, making the plan less expensive than it looks at first.2</span><br />
<span class="text left">Unfortunately, the </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Policy_Center">Tax Policy Center</span> — which, despite some criticism from <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republicans</span> in the last presidential race, is probably the closest thing out there to a neutral observer — doesn’t produce dynamic estimates. But its well-regarded static estimates can still be a useful baseline. Take the <span class="entity E2E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="proportional counter that detects charged particles and photons">TPC</span>’s recent analysis of <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio">Rubio</span>’s tax plan, which the center concluded would reduce federal revenue by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">$6.8 trillion</span> over <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">10 years</span>, or <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">about 2.6 percent</span> of economic output. That’s <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">close to half</span> of all discretionary spending. Think of that as a worst-case scenario for <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio">Rubio</span>. <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Foundation">The Tax Foundation</span>’s dynamic analysis — which concludes <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio">Rubio</span>’s plan would cut revenues by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">$2.4 trillion</span>, or <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">about 1 percent</span> of economic output — is, if not a best-case scenario, then at least an optimistic one. (The range of credible outcomes is wider for <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz">Cruz</span><span class="text right">’s plan because it has more moving parts.)</span><br />
<span class="text left">Not all points along that spectrum of possible outcomes are equally plausible, of course. Most mainstream economists think </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Friedman_(economist)">Friedman</span>’s analysis of <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span>’s plan is based on unrealistic assumptions — and I tend to agree. (<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics">Economists</span> have directed their harshest criticism at <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Friedman_(economist)">Friedman</span>’s analysis, not at the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span><span class="text right"> plan itself, much of which is basically a more aggressive version fairly standard liberal policies.) But that doesn’t mean mainstream economists are right. At a certain point, voters still have to decide who they believe.</span>
