<span class="text left">"ACCORDING to an article published in </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News">Bloomberg</span>, on <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">February 28th</span> <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> introduced “surge pricing” to its theme parks. Now, when I think of surge pricing, I think of an annoying little screen that appears on my smartphone making sure that I’m happy to pay <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">6x</span> the normal fare for my cab home. Conditional on having opened the app, my demand for taxis is insensitive enough that I’ll almost always click the ‘<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINE">Fine</span><span class="text right">, rinse me’ button.</span><br />
<span class="text left">One thing comforts me as the slow-moving traffic burns a hole in my bank balance: at least the higher fare might have encouraged my fine chauffeur on to the road. </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</span>, the master of surge pricing (they have been trying to patent it since <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">2013</span>) claims that is the benefit of surge pricing: it equilibrates supply and demand. A study <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">last year</span><span class="text right"> that they published showed that when their surge pricing mechanism broke, waiting times exploded and the rate of fulfilled rider requests plummeted.</span><br />
<span class="text left">So what might surge pricing for </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> look like? When queues are long, ride prices rise, encouraging <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> employees to switch on even more rides…? Some sort of dynamic pricing system for the park, where ticket prices rise and fall depending on demand for <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">that day</span><span class="text right">?</span><br />
<span class="text left">Not quite. This surge pricing that </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> is implementing (<span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">today</span>) is not actually surge pricing. <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">First</span>, because there is no clear mechanism for supply to increase in response to price. More taxi drivers can flood on to the streets in response to a price rise, but <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> will struggle to offer more park. <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">Second</span>, because the price changes will be nowhere near as dynamic. Prices will be higher at certain times of <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">the year</span>, but parents will not arrive at the gates of <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney's_Animal_Kingdom">Animal Kingdom</span><span class="text right"> to find that a glimpse of the massive artificial tree has doubled in price since they left the house.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Instead, what </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Disney world</span> is doing is old-fashioned price discrimination. In <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">summertime</span>, when the living is easy and children need entertaining, demand is high, and relatively insensitive to price. A sensible monopolist (sort of—though if you want to argue that <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Disney world</span> faces perfect competition then be my guest) should try to tap those willing to pay through the nose during peak times, and coax in the cheapos when it’s quieter. Discouraging the crowds in peak <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">hours</span><span class="text right"> should improve the visitor experience, by smoothing visitor numbers.</span><br />
<span class="text left">It is somewhat extraordinary that </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> was not already doing this—the idea is not a new one. <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater">Cinemas</span> offer cut-price tickets in <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">the middle of the day</span>, airlines offer cheaper seats with less leg room and flying at ungodly hours—surely it cannot just have occurred to <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> to charge more when more people want to go? (<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparently">Apparently</span><span class="text right"> accommodation does get pricier during peak times.)</span><br />
<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> is not alone. The <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News">Bloomberg</span> article reports that <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios_Hollywood">Universal Studios Hollywood</span> introduced a system <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">earlier this month</span> that “allows savings of <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">as much as $20</span> off on <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">non-peak days</span>, compared with the standard $<span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">95</span> admission.” <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">Earlier this month</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">There is a chance that the themeparks were contributing towards a public good—by having the same price </span><span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">all year round</span><span class="text right">, there is less of an incentive to take children out of school in search of a cheaper holiday. The change is a disaster for people who particularly hate queuing and who previously could avoid the crowds by going at ‘off-peak’ times. Or it could be that someone up high thought it would be unfair to charge different prices for what some would see as the same product. All other explanations welcome."</span>
