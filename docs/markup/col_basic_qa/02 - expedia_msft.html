<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia Inc.</span> on <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday">Wednesday</span> said it agreed to buy vacation rental site <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway Inc.</span> for about $3.9 billion in cash and stock, in a move that could ramp up competition with apartment-sharing startup <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb">Airbnb</span>. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia</span>, the world's largest online travel agency by bookings, said it expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2016 subject to regulatory approval. It expects the takeover will hurt its earnings per share next year but boost results in the long run. The news marks the largest acquisition in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia</span>'s history and the latest in a buying spree that began in 2014, in which the company bought <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitz">Orbitz Worldwide Inc.</span> for $1.3 billion and <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelocity">Travelocity</span> for $280 million. More importantly, the deal brings into focus the rise of alternative lodging, a market that <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia</span> values at around $100 billion. It agreed to pay a roughly 20-percent premium above <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway</span>'s share price. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_&_Poor's">S&P</span> <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)">Capital</span> IQ analyst Tuna Amobi called the purchase "transformational," saying it lets <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia</span> "participate in the sharing economy, which might be the next frontier" for leisure travel. While <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia</span> now markets hotel rooms, overlapping little with <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb">Airbnb</span>, analysts have warned that competition with the startup could become fierce by 2018. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb">Airbnb</span> is expected to double bookings to about 80 million nights this year alone. By contrast, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia</span> booked some 150 million nights in 2014. In an interview, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia</span> <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">Chief Executive</span> <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_Khosrowshahi">Dara Khosrowshahi</span> said <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway</span> will become "more aggressive" in marketing urban apartment shares that face off with <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb">Airbnb</span>. By contrast, beach and ski rentals account for a large portion of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway</span>'s bookings. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway</span>'s business model has also differed from that of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb">Airbnb</span>, which lets homeowners add listings for free but charges travelers a service fee. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction">Transactions</span> occur on site. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway</span> instead lets homeowners and property managers pay to advertise listings, with many transactions occurring off-site. However, it has announced that all listings would be available for direct booking by the end of next year, and it is adding a traveler fee. "We are going to help <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway</span> accelerate in its transition from a listings model to a booking model," <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_Khosrowshahi">Khosrowshahi</span> said, adding this will help it compete with <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb">Airbnb</span>. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group">Expedia</span> expects <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway</span> to operate somewhat autonomously. It believes <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeAway">HomeAway</span><span class="text right"> will earn about $350 million in 2018 before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, up from $119.3 million in 2014, both on an adjusted basis.</span>
