<span class="text left">"ACCORDING to an article published in </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News">Bloomberg</span>, on February 28th <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> introduced “surge pricing” to its theme parks. Now, when I think of surge pricing, I think of an annoying little screen that appears on my smartphone making sure that I’m happy to pay 6x the normal fare for my cab home. Conditional on having opened the app, my demand for taxis is insensitive enough that I’ll almost always click the ‘<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINE">Fine</span><span class="text right">, rinse me’ button.</span><br />
<span class="text left">One thing comforts me as the slow-moving traffic burns a hole in my bank balance: at least the higher fare might have encouraged my fine chauffeur on to the road. </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</span><span class="text right">, the master of surge pricing (they have been trying to patent it since 2013) claims that is the benefit of surge pricing: it equilibrates supply and demand. A study last year that they published showed that when their surge pricing mechanism broke, waiting times exploded and the rate of fulfilled rider requests plummeted.</span><br />
<span class="text left">So what might surge pricing for </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> look like? When queues are long, ride prices rise, encouraging <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span><span class="text right"> employees to switch on even more rides…? Some sort of dynamic pricing system for the park, where ticket prices rise and fall depending on demand for that day?</span><br />
<span class="text left">Not quite. This surge pricing that </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> is implementing (today) is not actually surge pricing. First, because there is no clear mechanism for supply to increase in response to price. More taxi drivers can flood on to the streets in response to a price rise, but <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> will struggle to offer more park. Second, because the price changes will be nowhere near as dynamic. Prices will be higher at certain times of the year, but parents will not arrive at the gates of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney's_Animal_Kingdom">Animal Kingdom</span><span class="text right"> to find that a glimpse of the massive artificial tree has doubled in price since they left the house.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Instead, what </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Disney world</span> is doing is old-fashioned price discrimination. In summertime, when the living is easy and children need entertaining, demand is high, and relatively insensitive to price. A sensible monopolist (sort of—though if you want to argue that <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Disney world</span><span class="text right"> faces perfect competition then be my guest) should try to tap those willing to pay through the nose during peak times, and coax in the cheapos when it’s quieter. Discouraging the crowds in peak hours should improve the visitor experience, by smoothing visitor numbers.</span><br />
<span class="text left">It is somewhat extraordinary that </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> was not already doing this—the idea is not a new one. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater">Cinemas</span> offer cut-price tickets in the middle of the day, airlines offer cheaper seats with less leg room and flying at ungodly hours—surely it cannot just have occurred to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> to charge more when more people want to go? (<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparently">Apparently</span><span class="text right"> accommodation does get pricier during peak times.)</span><br />
<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</span> is not alone. The <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News">Bloomberg</span> article reports that <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios_Hollywood">Universal Studios Hollywood</span><span class="text right"> introduced a system earlier this month that “allows savings of as much as $20 off on non-peak days, compared with the standard $95 admission.” Earlier this month.</span><br />
<span class="text left">There is a chance that the themeparks were contributing towards a public good—by having the same price all year round, there is less of an incentive to take children out of school in search of a cheaper holiday. The change is a disaster for people who particularly hate queuing and who previously could avoid the crowds by going at ‘off-peak’ times. Or it could be that someone up high thought it would be unfair to charge different prices for what some would see as the same product. All other explanations welcome."</span>
