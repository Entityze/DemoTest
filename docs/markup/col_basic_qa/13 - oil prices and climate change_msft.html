<span class="text left">A few months ago at the </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">Paris climate talks</span>, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">President Barack Obama</span> and a panoply of world leaders talked at length about the importance of reducing <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> pollution associated with burning <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal">coal</span>, the largest source of greenhouse <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas">gases</span>. So far there is only one way to do that without pulling the plug on <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal">coal</span> altogether: <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage">carbon capture and storage (CCS</span>), a process by which <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span><span class="text right"> is pulled from a smokestack before it escapes into the air and is then buried deep underground.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Nearly every plan to mitigate global warming includes CCS, yet few countries have adopted the technology because there is little incentive to make the costly investment. Decades ago, however, </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">the U.S.</span><span class="text right"> found a clever way to make the method economically viable: tie CCS to oil recovery. And while the scheme seemed to work, low oil prices now are putting CCS—and therefore almost all climate cleanup plans—in jeopardy.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Oil-field workers first pumped </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> down into oil wells in 1972. Called <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery">enhanced oil recovery (EOR</span>), the technique boosts the amount of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">petroleum</span> that a well yields because the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas">gas</span> eases the flow of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">oil</span>, restores pressure underground to force more <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">oil</span> to the surface, and slips into nooks and crannies that other aids, such as <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water">water</span>, will simply flow around. During the process, a portion of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> becomes trapped underground like the oil before it. “<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">It</span> will stay there for eternity,” says Richard Esposito, a geologist who has worked to develop CCS at the coal-burning electric utility <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Company">Southern Company</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">This arrangement—using </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> to get oil—is one of the few ways to make carbon capture pay, says Julio Friedmann, the principal deputy assistant secretary for fossil energy at the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</span>. “<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery">EOR</span> has been the dominant storage mode because it produces revenue,” he explains. In other words, it potentially satisfies oil companies and environmentalists. With money to be made, a handful of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery">EOR</span> projects popped up across <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">the U.S.</span> over the past few decades. For example, at the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinsley,_Mississippi">Tinsley</span> oil field in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River">Mississippi</span>, the oil and natural gas company <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denbury_Resources">Denbury Resources</span> began flooding wells with <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span><span class="text right"> in March 2008 and now recycles some 670 million cubic feet (19 million cubic meters) of the gas every day—increasing its oil production from 50 barrels a day to more than 9,000 barrels a day.</span><br />
<span class="text left">In fact, </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denbury">Denbury</span> and several other companies using <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery">EOR</span> need so much <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> that they recently contracted to buy the pollution from a new coal-fired power plant in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemper_County,_Mississippi">Kemper County</span>, Mississippi—the ultimate goal of the scheme. Such so-called anthropogenic <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> now makes up roughly a quarter of all the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span><span class="text right"> used for this type of oil recovery (the rest comes from natural deposits trapped in geologic domes).</span><br />
<span class="text left">The relationship between CCS and </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery">EOR</span> is fragile, however. Because the price of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">oil</span> has dipped so dramatically over the past couple of years, burying <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> no longer pays. Plummeting prices have made it difficult for <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery">EOR</span> companies to bring in enough money to pay for new machinery, such as pumps, compressors and specialized pipelines, says Dan Cole, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denbury">Denbury</span>'s vice president of commercial development and governmental relations. Already oil-field services giant <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlumberger">Schlumberger</span> has shut down its <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon">Carbon</span> <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_services">Services</span> unit, which was supposed to turn <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> into a steady business, and others are considering similar moves. Those closures could throw a wrench into the climate cleanup efforts carefully laid out in recent reports by the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency">International Energy Agency</span> and the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">At the same time, the troubled relationship may highlight the irony of crafting planet-saving scenarios that rely on oil extraction. After all, burning the extra </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">oil</span> produced by pumping <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> underground produces more <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span><span class="text right"> that ends up in the atmosphere, causing yet more global warming.</span><br />
<span class="text left">And there are alternative solutions to pay for CCS, although they are far from application. For example, one way to encourage burying </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO2</span> pollution directly is to provide a $50-per-metric-ton tax credit for such sequestration, says the doe's Friedmann. He adds, “<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The</span><span class="text right"> harsh mathematics of atmospheric accumulation make it clear that CCS needs to be a climate solution.”</span>
