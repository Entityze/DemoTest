<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_on_Earth_(film)">Here on Earth</span><span class="text right">, your height is mostly determined by the genes you inherit from your parents. And once you’ve stopped growing, your dreams of getting any taller are pretty much kaput--unless you go to space.</span><br />
<span class="text left">When </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Kelly_(astronaut)">Scott Kelly</span> returned to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span> this week after spending almost a year on the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">International Space Station</span>, he came back about two inches taller than when he left <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">What caused this growth? Spending time in a </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness">zero-G</span> environment like that of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">International Space Station</span> causes the spine to stretch. On <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth">Earth, gravity</span><span class="text right"> keeps the vertebrae in place by constantly pushing them together. But without gravity, the vertebrae will naturally expand slightly, causing a person to become taller.</span><br />
<span class="text left">However, this growth is minor and temporary. Typically, astronauts in space can grow up to three percent of their original height, but no more than that. And after a few months back on </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth">Earth, gravity</span><span class="text right"> will shrink a person back to her original height.</span><br />
<span class="text left">In addition to this height increase, </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness">zero-G</span> environments also come with a large list of other potential side effects to the human body, many of which are still pretty unknown--a reason why <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</span> is currently studying both <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Kelly_(astronaut)">Scott Kelly</span> and his identical twin <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly">Mark</span>, who unlike his brother spent this past year on <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span><span class="text right">, to better understand these physiological changes.</span><br />
<span class="text left">So if you do wish you were slightly taller, consider becoming an astronaut who participates in long term space missions. But remember to relish your extended height when you’re up there, because once you get back down to </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span><span class="text right"> it’s all going to shrink.</span>
