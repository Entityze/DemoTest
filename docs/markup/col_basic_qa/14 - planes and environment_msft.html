<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winter">THE winter</span> holidays are around the corner, and that means a spike in air travel. A year ago, according to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America</span>’s <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Transportation_Statistics">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</span>, the number of miles travelled on the county’s airlines jumped 10% between <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November">November</span> and <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December">December</span><span class="text right">, before declining 16% over the following two months. So as you book trips to see friends and family (or to travel for business—but let’s hope not), how guilty should you feel about the extra carbon you are causing to be spewed into the atmosphere?</span><br />
<span class="text left">The answer depends on whether you consider your actions as an individual or as a representative of the offending species.</span><br />
<span class="text left">By the former criterion, Gulliver has good news for you: environmental damage caused by flying is a lot less than it would have been a few decades ago. According to a study by Michael Sivak at </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan">the University of Michigan</span>, picked up by <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Jones_(magazine)">Mother Jones</span>, the average amount of energy consumed per mile, per passenger, fell by 74% on domestic flights in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America</span><span class="text right"> between 1970 and 2010.</span><br />
<span class="text left">There are two main reasons for the drop. First, aircraft manufacturers are obsessed with making their planes more </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel">fuel</span> efficient, and they are doing pretty well. As they have added thrust, reduced wind resistance and shed weight, they boosted the fuel efficiency of new planes by nearly 50% between 1968 and 2014. Second, flights are fuller than they used to be. According to the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Transportation_Statistics">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</span><span class="text right">, since 2002 (admittedly not the fairest baseline, since 9/11-related fears were still fresh, but that’s where the data begin) the average flight has gone from 70% of capacity to 85%. More passengers means less fuel consumed per passenger.</span><br />
<span class="text left">As a result, on average a commercial jet now requires only half as much fuel to move someone one mile as a car does, according to the </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan">Michigan</span> research. (<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving">Driving</span> has become more efficient, too—just not nearly as fast as flying has.) Of course virtually no one flies just one mile. The average domestic flight is 914 miles—about 100 times longer than the typical car journey. Since longer car trips generally take place on fast-moving highways while short flights consume a bigger proportion of their <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel">fuel</span><span class="text right"> on takeoff and landing, driving is more efficient for trips between 300 and 500 miles.</span><br />
<span class="text left">For all of that, in the aggregate travellers have more than undone the gains in fuel efficiency by flying a whole lot more than they used to. </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Transportation">The Department of Transportation</span><span class="text right"> reports that on domestic routes, passenger miles rose from 31 billion in 1960 to 565 billion in 2010—a far greater change than the improvements in fuel efficiency or the drop in marginal emissions per passenger.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Of course, you can’t help what others are doing. And if you still feel guilty about the emissions you are contributing, diminished though they may be, you can assuage your guilt by buying carbon offsets. According to the offset calculator on the </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClimateCare">ClimateCare</span> website, just $12.40 buys enough offsets to compensate for a round-trip flight from <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</span> to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York</span><span class="text right">. The offset system does have its flaws. Not least of which is that it does exactly what it’s intended to do: make people feel less guilty about activities that harm the planet. For those that really care, there is always the train.</span>
