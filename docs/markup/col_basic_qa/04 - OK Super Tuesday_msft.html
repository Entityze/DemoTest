What’s more, that cowboy individualism could take us one step closer to deciphering the desires of the 2016 <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</span> electorate, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</span><span class="text right">’s supporters’ in particular.</span><br />
<span class="text left">The </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span> stakes on the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</span> side of the race are fairly straightforward. After his nearly 50 percentage point loss in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina">South Carolina</span> on Saturday, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span>’s chances for the nomination are dimming, and the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont">Vermont</span> senator is looking to scoop up any delegates he can. His prospects in most <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday">Super Tuesday</span> states are looking bleak. But over the past month or so, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> has eaten into <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Hillary Clinton</span>’s lead in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span> — chomped through it, actually. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span><span class="text right"> went from being down 25 points in mid-January to bringing the race to within 2 points by mid-February in one poll. He recently said flat-out he thinks he’ll win the state.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Why the surge?</span><br />
<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</span> has a solid history in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span>. She won the state handily in the 2008 primary, but as we all know by now, the first rule of the 2016 election season is that there are no rules. It might be the eau de anti-establishment ambrosia that <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> has doused himself in, but he appears to be appealing to the overwhelmingly white, middle to lower-middle class <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</span> voters in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span> in ways that he hasn’t been able to with minorities in other parts of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States">the South</span> (see: <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina">South Carolina</span>). Eighty-two percent of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span>’s <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries">2008 Democratic primary</span><span class="text right"> voters were white and half had yearly household incomes between $30,000 and $75,000.</span><br />
<span class="text left">In some ways, according to Keith Gaddie, chair of the </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</span>’s department of political science, this <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> support is a return to the state’s historic political roots. “<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span> is where your <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Agrarians">Southern agrarian</span> populism and <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska">Nebraska</span> prairie populism collided in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America</span><span class="text right">,” he said of the state forged by homesteaders in the late 19th century. Gaddie noted that for the first couple of decades after statehood in the early 20th century, “there was a really strong socialist political strength; we at one point had five socialists in the state legislature.”</span><br />
<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span>’s present-day polling still bears this out. “I think there is still a strong populism in the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span> electorate, both <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</span> and <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democrat</span>,” said Bill Shapard, who runs SoonerPoll, one of the state’s independent public opinion polling firms. “That’s why you’re seeing <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</span> doing well, because he’s the most populist candidate of the bunch, and I think <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Bernie Sanders</span> is much more the populist candidate on the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democrat</span><span class="text right"> side.”</span><br />
<span class="text left">The notion that </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</span> and <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> are pulling different ends of the same troubled <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">American</span> heartstring is not new, but over the disparate strains of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse,_Oklahoma">Muse</span> tunes and “<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustang_Sally_(song)">Mustang Sally</span>” at the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Convention_Center">Cox Convention Center</span> in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Oklahoma_City">downtown Oklahoma City</span> on <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday">Sunday</span>, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan">Paul</span> and Sherelle Bowermann were living proof of this theory. They, along with over 4,000 other Oklahomans, had come to hear <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> speak at an event that included <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native American</span> dancing and the obligatory rendition of “<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Land_Is_Your_Land">This Land Is Your Land</span>” (<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</span> was from <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span>, after all). The Bowermanns were supporting the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont">Vermont</span> senator, but “believe it or not, our second choice is <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</span>,” said Sherelle, 73. In a general election, given the choice between the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">Manhattan</span> businessman and <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Clinton</span>, they would vote for <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</span>. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan">Paul</span>, 68, who characterized his political outlook as “eclectic,” liked that <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Sanders</span> seemed “more compassionate to people who are down and out” and that <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</span><span class="text right"> seemed to be “protesting the powers that be, the billionaires that run the country.”</span><br />
<span class="text left">There are numbers to back up this populist enthusiasm, a messy purple watercolor of </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">reds</span> and blues bleeding together rather than a neat, paint-by-numbers rendering of party-line adherence. According to Pam Slater of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Election_Board">Oklahoma State Election Board</span>, the state has seen a spike in both new voter registrations and requests to change party affiliation. From Jan. 1 through Feb. 26, the state has registered 13,340 <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democrats</span> and 20,929 <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republicans</span>. During the same time period, the office saw just over 5,000 <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democrats</span> apply to change their registration to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</span>, and nearly 1,500 switch from being registered <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician">Independents</span> to the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">GOP</span>.1 Shapard called the movement a “micro-trend,” likely of voters who see the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</span> appeal or, at the very least, want in on the action of this year’s <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</span><span class="text right"> race.</span><br />
<span class="text left">This could be a sign of things to come, and </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)">Tuesday</span>, when 12 states scrum for delegates, might very well be when the faint patterns of the race are finally drawn in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpie_(marker)">Sharpie</span> rather than in pencil. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span>’s middle-class, white <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democrats</span><span class="text right"> changing party affiliation to vote for Trump could foreshadow what voters of comparable demographics in states like Michigan and Ohio might do.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Oklahoma could also prove to be another relevant data point in ending the myth of the evangelical vote as monolith. Shapard calls South Carolina a bellwether for Oklahoma — “We’re much more Western than they are, but our electorate still mirrors theirs; Republicanism is high, evangelicals are high” — and in South Carolina, Trump won 34 percent of the evangelical vote. It makes sense to expect about the same in Oklahoma, especially given the flaws of Ted Cruz’s operation, which once upon a time in the alternate reality of six months or so ago seemed to be the perfect vehicle for the religious conservative vote. Cruz has been tainted by his campaign’s unsavory public reputation, according to Shapard, including accusations that the operation spread rumors of Ben Carson dropping out of the race the night of the Iowa caucuses. It’s not a look that plays well with many evangelical voters. “Cruz may have won the battle in the Iowa caucus, but it ended up costing him the war,” Shapard said.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Gaddie, of the University of Oklahoma, characterized evangelical voters as being split into a couple of groups, those who “vote culture war” — on issues of school prayer, abortion and the like — and those “who think of themselves as Christian nationalists.” Those latter voters, he said, “think the United States was established as a Christian nation, they think that separation of church and state is overblown and they want to see a candidate who’s about American nationalism, restoring American pride. That’s what Trump taps into.”"</span>
