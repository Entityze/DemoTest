One of the metrics of our vision of K-State 2025 concerns the number  of faculty members who receive national awards .  In the past years ,  K-State has had very few faculty members receive such awards .  Part <span class="entity E3" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="vertical structure, usually solid, that defines and sometimes protects an area">of  </span>the problem is that very few faculty members have been nominated or  have applied for these awards <span class="entity E3" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="light rail system in the Seattle metropolitan area">.  W</span>e believe we have many outstanding  scholars at K-State , and such awards are only possible if we nominate  them .  My office has put together a website  -- http://www.k-state.edu/provost/resources/natlawards.htm —  that lists all of these prestigious national awards , providing a  description , eligible areas and faculty ranks , and the award website  for more information on their application process .  The awards are  listed chronologically by their application deadlines .  We  wanted to make this information available early enough so that  faculty , department heads , and deans can have adequate time to  prepare nomination<span class="entity E5" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="To allow (a custom, tradition, etc.); to give credence or acceptance to.">s and a</span>pplications .  We hope that this information  will generate the interest necessary so that our top scholars from  across the university will be considered for and eventually receive  these prestigious awards .  It should be noted that the awards are not only for longtime scholars .  They vary in terms of conten<span class="entity E2" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="process of calculating the position of objects in space subject to various constraints">t area</span>s ( e.g. , humanities , sciences , art ,  or biomedicine ) as well as nominee rank ( full professor , mid-career  professor , early career scholar , or post-doctoral ) .
