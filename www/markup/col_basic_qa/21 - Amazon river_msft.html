A previous study suggested that the about-face was triggered by gradual changes in the flow of hot, viscous rock deep beneath the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South American continent</span>. But new computer models hint that the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Turn_(1997_film)">U-turn</span> resulted from more familiar geological processes taking place at <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth's</span> surface—in particular, the persistent erosion, movement, and deposition of sediment wearing away from the growing <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">Andes</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">The Andes mountains</span> lie just inland of the western coast of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</span>. The central portion of that mountain range began growing about 65 million years ago, and the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">northern Andes</span> started rising a few million years later, says Victor Sacek, a geophysicist at the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_São_Paulo">University of São Paulo</span> in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil">Brazil</span>. Yet, field studies suggest that the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River">Amazon River</span>, which today carries sediment-laden water from <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span> across the continent to the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</span>, didn't exist in its current form until about 10 million years ago. Before then, rainfall across much of what is now the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_basin">Amazon Basin</span> drained westward into massive lakes that formed along the eastern rim of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span> and then flowed north via rivers into <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean">the Caribbean</span><span class="text right">. The geological processes that caused ancient drainage patterns to shift to their modern configurations have been hotly debated.</span><br />
<span class="text left">The lakes east of </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span> formed in a long trough created when the immense weight of that growing mountain chain pressed <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)">Earth's crust</span> downward, Sacek says. But for some reason, the terrain beneath the trough slowly gained elevation over millions of years, and those lakes gradually gave way to a long-lived region of wetlands covering an area the size of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt</span> or larger. Later, after the landscape rose even farther, the wetlands disappeared altogether. Previously, scientists proposed that changes in the circulation of molten material in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth's</span> mantle—the slow-flowing material that lies between our planet's core and its crust—pushed the terrain east of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span><span class="text right"> upward, thereby changing drainage patterns.</span><br />
<span class="text left">But new research pins the blame on something more mundane: erosion. Sacek developed a computer model that includes interactions between growth of </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span>, the flexing of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)">Earth's crust</span> in the region, and climate. (For instance, as the mountains rise, they intercept more moist airflow and receive more rainfall, which in turn boosts the rate of erosion.) The model simulates the evolution of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South American</span> terrain during the past 40 million years—a period that commenced after the birth of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">central Andes</span><span class="text right"> but before the eastern flank of those mountains began to rise, Sacek notes.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Results of the simulation reproduce much of the evidence seen in the geological record, Sacek reports online ahead of print in </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_and_Planetary_Science_Letters">Earth and Planetary Science Letters</span>. Initially, the lakes form east of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span> because the mountains press <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)">Earth's crust</span> downward to form a trough faster than sediment can fill it. Then the sinking of the terrain slows down, and accumulation of sediment spilling off <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span> catches up, gradually filling in the lakes and building the landscape higher. Eventually, the terrain just east of the mountain chain becomes higher than that in the eastern realm of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_basin">Amazon Basin</span>, a shift that provides a downhill slope extending all the way from <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span> to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">the Atlantic</span><span class="text right"> beginning about 10 million years ago.</span><br />
<span class="text left">"</span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion">Erosion</span> and sedimentation are powerful forces," says Jean Braun, a geophysicist at <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier_University">Joseph Fourier University</span> in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble">Grenoble, France</span>. Sacek's model shows that these processes explain the geological record seen in northern <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</span>, "and they do so with the right timing," he adds. They also suggest that the amount of sediment carried to the mouth of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River">the Amazon</span><span class="text right"> each year and then dumped offshore should increase over time—something actually seen in sediment cores drilled from that area. "That's a nice bit of prediction by the model," Braun says.</span><br />
<span class="text left">The gradually increasing rate of sediment accumulation possibly stems from the long time needed for the material to hopscotch its way across the continent, being dumped in one spot and then remobilized by erosion later, says Carina Hoorn, a geologist at the </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</span>. Or, she suggests, the increase may stem from a geologically recent boost in erosion in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes">the Andes</span><span class="text right"> triggered by a series of ice ages that commenced about 2.4 million years ago.</span><br />
<span class="text left">One thing Sacek's model doesn't do a good job of predicting, he admits, is the size, shape, and persistence of the large area of wetlands that formed in what is now the central </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_basin">Amazon Basin</span><span class="text right"> between 10.5 million and 16 million years ago. But it's possible, he notes, that changes in mantle circulation beneath the region did play a minor role in the evolution of the terrain. Sacek will try to incorporate such processes into future versions of his terrain simulation, to see if they better explain how the landscape evolved.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Such changes in mantle flow are "difficult to quantify and even more difficult to discern [in the real world]," Braun says. But by combining the modest effects of such changes with those triggered by surface processes such as erosion, "you might end up with something that works."</span>
