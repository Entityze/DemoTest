<span class="text left">According to satellite data from Brazil’s </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Space_Research">National Space Research Institute</span>, deforestation rates in the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazônia_Legal">Brazilian Amazon</span> dropped 18% this year, reaching the second-lowest recorded level since monitoring started over 20 years ago. An estimated 4,848 square kilometers of virgin rainforest were cleared in the 12-month period to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_30">June 30</span><span class="text right">, compared to 5,891 square kilometers in the previous 12-month period.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Brazil has been one of the more notorious clear cutters of native jungle, with large campaigns being waged by firms like </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace">Greenpeace</span> to chastise the government.  <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">American</span> multinational <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargill">Cargil</span> faced the brunt of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace">Greenpeace</span>’s fury in 2004-05 when it successfully managed to convince <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's">McDonald</span>’s not to purchase <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat">meat</span> from <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">chickens</span> fed on soybeans grown and transported out of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River">the Amazon</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Even though Brazil is home to the largest rainforest on </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span>, the jungle is home to over three million people, including the 1.8 million inhabitants of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus">Manaus</span>, the capital city of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazonas_(Brazilian_state)">Amazonas state</span><span class="text right">, in the heart of the forest. The region, therefore, is in constant need of transportation, housing, and commodities for human consumption.</span><br />
<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_of_the_Amazon_rainforest">Amazon deforestation</span> declined to its lowest percentage rate since 1988. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging">Loggers</span><span class="text right"> and local subsistence farmers continue to hack away at the world’s largest rainforest, only at a slower rate over the last 12 months than in previous years.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Brazil’s efforts at preserving the rainforest have received a healthy mix of cheers and jeers over the years. But this week’s satellite data is a nice slap in the back for the </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_the_Environment_(Brazil)">Ministry of the Environment</span><span class="text right">. The department is often at odds with the administration’s plans to develop the region. Declines in deforestation make it look like the government is doing a good job policing illegal clear cutting, and controlling the expansion of commercial cattle ranching and soybean farms.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Moreover, some of Brazil’s largest infrastructure projects today are hydroelectric dams being built along </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River">Amazon River</span> tributaries. The <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Monte_Dam">Belo Monte dam</span>, for instance, is the largest hydroelectric power project currently being constructed in the world today. When complete, it will be the third largest hydroelectric power station, roughly half the size of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam">Three Gorges Dam</span> that crosses the Yangtze River of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</span>. Brazil’s <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itaipu_Dam">Itaipu dam</span> is the second largest. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Monte_Dam">Belo Monte</span> is located along the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xingu_River">Xingu River</span> in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pará">Para state</span>, the second largest state in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River">the Amazon</span><span class="text right">. A couple hundred acres of rainforest were cleared to build the dam.</span><br />

The data gets submitted by the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Brazil">Brazilian government</span> for external auditing. The new 2014 data represents a reduction of 83% in deforestation rates compared to 2004 levels, and indicate a resumption of the trend of falling <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_in_Brazil">deforestation in Brazil</span>. Improved policing of forestry, agribusiness coupled with greater income opportunities for poorer land owners has led to declines in cut rates over the years. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty">Poor</span> land owners would often cut forest in order to raise more <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle">cattle</span><span class="text right"> for income.</span>
