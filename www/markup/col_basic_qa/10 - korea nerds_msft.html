It boasts a kaleidoscopic display of 800-odd artefacts mainly from the universe of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">Japanese manga</span> (comic books) and anime (animation), and <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">American</span><span class="text right"> cartoons. Most of its visitors are adult men.</span><br />
<span class="text left">The museum’s enthusiastic young guide says it is “heaven for deukhu like me”. The term comes from the </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japanese</span> otaku, and denotes those who pursue obsessive interests—think a “nerd” or an “anorak” with few social skills and a fetish for some aspect of popular culture. In <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</span>, deukhu has long been a slur. Many associate it with a dangerously unpatriotic indulgence in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Japan">Japanese cultural</span> exports, many of them banned in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</span> from the end of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</span><span class="text right">’s imperial rule in 1945 until as recently as the 1990s. More broadly deukhu were assumed to lead idle, unproductive lives, shut away in dingy flats playing video games or scouring the web for their next frivolous curio.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Now attitudes are shifting. The social-media networks of cool 20-somethings are abuzz with the hashtag deukmingout: coming out as a fanatic. A </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korean</span> daily declared the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_Museum">Figure Museum</span> W to be “a <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca">Mecca</span>” for geeks going public. A 28-year-old deukhu, a fan of a <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop">South Korean pop</span> star, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Junsu">Kim Jun-su</span><span class="text right">, has started a blog about her coming-out. In it she argues that deukhu pursuits can be highly productive: the example of her idol has inspired her to get fit and to take up the piano and guitar. “I work even harder in my day job to prove a deukhu can be successful,” she says.</span><br />
<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Junsu">Kim</span> Yong-sub, who has written a book on <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korean</span> trends in 2016, says that as more prominent deukhu have created content from their pastimes—by writing online comics, for example, known in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</span> as webtoons—they have aspired to “a new social standing and role”. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji_Jin-hee">Ji Jin-hee</span>, a dashing 44-year-old actor, revealed that he bought piles of secondhand <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego">Lego</span> to build models and sell them for a small fortune (he appeared on the cover of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)">Elle Korea</span> surrounded by his creations). Other <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">Korean</span> celebrities have been admitting to their own eccentricities: fans now affectionately refer to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_Hyung-tak">Shim Hyung-tak</span> as “Shimdakhu” after the actor disclosed a passion for <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon">Doraemon</span>, a <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japanese</span> robot-cat cartoon character beloved of <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia">East Asian</span> children.

<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uijeongbu_KB_Insurance_Stars">Stars</span> are helping to push the idea that geekishness is cool. But beyond that, <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCune–Reischauer">Mr</span> <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Junsu">Kim</span> says, is the growing cachet of not following mainstream taste: a turnaround for <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Korea">South Koreans</span> under powerful social pressure to conform. As more people pursue their individual preferences, they become more accepting of others’ too, for example, of the rise of the samchonpaen (“uncle fans”), middle-aged men who are unabashed groupies of teenage pop bands. Since <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November">November</span><span class="text right"> “Super-skilled People”, a television show, has invited deukhu, from bread enthusiasts to weapons buffs, to show off remarkable abilities or specialisms.
