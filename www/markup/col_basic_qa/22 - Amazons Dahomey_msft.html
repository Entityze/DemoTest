<span class="text left">From the 17th century until the end of the 19th century, there was an incredible army of women warriors named the </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons">Amazons</span>. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons">The Amazons</span>, also known as the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahomey_Amazons">Mino</span> or Gbêto, were a fully trained fearless female fighters. They were part of the largest ethnic group, the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fon_people">Fon</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">They were not allowed to be married or have children and most of them were virgins. The women were also </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V">the King</span>’s wife as well. They were married to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V">the King</span> voluntary or involuntary. For example, an involuntary case would be if a husband had a wife who refused to follow his rules, he would give that wife away to <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V">the King</span> so she can be forced to join the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons">Amazons</span> military.  The amazons having the status of being <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V">the King</span>’s wife is more of a way of saying that <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Dahomey">King</span><span class="text right"> owned them; they are not expected nor obligated to fulfill any marital duties. Their main role was to be diligent and protect the kingdom to the best of their ability.</span><br />
<span class="text left">They were known to be a fierce military and protected not only </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V">the King</span> but also the royal palace of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahomey">Kingdom of Dahomey</span>. They sharpened their teeth, some cut their left breast to better seat their guns on their chest and were notorious for decapitating the head of their enemies. They took pride in their title and showed it by training extremely hard. They’ve won most wars including beating <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">the French</span><span class="text right"> colonizers several times.</span><br />
<span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)">Today</span>, the descendants of these fearless warriors are keeping their legacy alive through different folkloric events that happen yearly in <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin">Benin</span>. The warriors are viewed as semi-goddesses and their names are called upon during incantations rituals taking place especially during the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_Vodun">Vodoun</span> festivals.  During these rites, the female dancers will be carrying a machete while making intricate dance moves. It is always amazing to see their choreography; Usually, women will stand in a circle barefoot and move together in a rhythmic, well-coordinated and rehearsed manner while swinging the machetes as though they are cutting branches off a <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree">tree</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">To resume, </span><span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin">Beninese</span> are really proud of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons">Amazons</span>. Women in particularly never shy away when one has to judge or compare their resilient character to those of the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons">Amazons</span>. In addition, I strongly believe that the <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons">Amazons</span> have contributed to these specific women attributes: strong, independent and unafraid women who aren’t afraid of taking risks in order to make things happen. <span class="entity E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Benin">Beninese women</span><span class="text right"> go for what they want and are unstoppable. Their drive and determination are visible on many levels that will be further discussed whiten the next few blogs. For now, these untamed and admirable women are what I would call being fierce!</span>
