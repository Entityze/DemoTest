<span class="entity DE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">THE winter holidays</span> are around the corner, and that means a spike in air travel. <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">A year ago</span>, according to <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America</span>’s <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Transportation_Statistics">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</span>, the number of miles travelled on the county’s airlines jumped <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">10%</span> <span class="entity DE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">between November and December</span>, before declining <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">16%</span> over <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">the following two months</span><span class="text right">. So as you book trips to see friends and family (or to travel for business—but let’s hope not), how guilty should you feel about the extra carbon you are causing to be spewed into the atmosphere?</span><br />
<span class="text left">The answer depends on whether you consider your actions as an individual or as a representative of the offending species.</span><br />
<span class="text left">By the former criterion, Gulliver has good news for you: environmental damage caused by flying is a lot less than it would have been </span><span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">a few decades ago</span>. According to a study by Michael Sivak at <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan">the University of Michigan</span>, picked up by <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Jones_(magazine)">Mother Jones</span>, the average amount of energy consumed per mile, per passenger, fell by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">74%</span> on domestic flights in <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America</span> <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">between 1970 and 2010</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">There are </span><span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">two</span> main reasons for the drop. <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">First</span>, aircraft manufacturers are obsessed with making their planes more <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel">fuel</span> efficient, and they are doing pretty well. As they have added thrust, reduced wind resistance and shed weight, they boosted the fuel efficiency of new planes by <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">nearly 50%</span> <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">between 1968 and 2014</span>. <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">Second</span>, flights are fuller than they used to be. According to the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Transportation_Statistics">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</span>, since <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">2002</span> (admittedly not the fairest baseline, since 9/11-related fears were still fresh, but that’s where the data begin) the average flight has gone from <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">70%</span> of capacity to <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">85%</span><span class="text right">. More passengers means less fuel consumed per passenger.</span><br />
<span class="text left">As a result, on average a commercial jet now requires </span><span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">only half</span> as much fuel to move someone one mile as a car does, according to the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan">Michigan</span> research. (<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving">Driving</span> has become more efficient, too—just not nearly as fast as flying has.) Of course virtually no one flies just one mile. The average domestic flight is 914 miles—<span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">about 100</span> times longer than the typical car journey. Since longer car trips generally take place on fast-moving highways while short flights consume a bigger proportion of their <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel">fuel</span><span class="text right"> on takeoff and landing, driving is more efficient for trips between 300 and 500 miles.</span><br />
<span class="text left">For all of that, in the aggregate travellers have more than undone the gains in fuel efficiency by flying a whole lot more than they used to. </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Transportation">The Department of Transportation</span> reports that on domestic routes, passenger miles rose from <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">31 billion</span> in <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">1960</span> to <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">565 billion</span><span class="text right"> in 2010—a far greater change than the improvements in fuel efficiency or the drop in marginal emissions per passenger.</span><br />
<span class="text left">Of course, you can’t help what others are doing. And if you still feel guilty about the emissions you are contributing, diminished though they may be, you can assuage your guilt by buying carbon offsets. According to the offset calculator on the </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClimateCare">ClimateCare</span> website, <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">just $12.40</span> buys enough offsets to compensate for a round-trip flight from <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</span> to <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York</span><span class="text right">. The offset system does have its flaws. Not least of which is that it does exactly what it’s intended to do: make people feel less guilty about activities that harm the planet. For those that really care, there is always the train.</span>
