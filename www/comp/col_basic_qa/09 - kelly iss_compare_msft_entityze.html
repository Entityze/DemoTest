<span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_on_Earth_(film)">Here on Earth</span><span class="text right">, your height is mostly determined by the genes you inherit from your parents. And once you’ve stopped growing, your dreams of getting any taller are pretty much kaput--unless you go to space.</span><br />
<span class="text left">When </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Kelly_(astronaut)">Scott Kelly</span> returned to <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span> <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">this week</span> after spending <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">almost a year</span> on the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">International Space Station</span>, he came back about two inches taller than when he left <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span><span class="text right">.</span><br />
<span class="text left">What caused this growth? Spending time in a </span><span class="entity DE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">zero</span>-G environment like that of the <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">International Space Station</span> causes the spine to stretch. On <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth">Earth, gravity</span><span class="text right"> keeps the vertebrae in place by constantly pushing them together. But without gravity, the vertebrae will naturally expand slightly, causing a person to become taller.</span><br />
<span class="text left">However, this growth is minor and temporary. Typically, astronauts in space can grow </span><span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Number, quantity, percentage">up to three percent</span> of their original height, but no more than that. And after <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">a few months</span> back on <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth">Earth, gravity</span><span class="text right"> will shrink a person back to her original height.</span><br />
<span class="text left">In addition to this height increase, </span><span class="entity E3E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="town in Thuringia, Germany">zero-G</span> environments also come with a large list of other potential side effects to the human body, many of which are still pretty unknown--a reason why <span class="entity E3E" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="independent agency of the United States Federal Government">NASA</span> is currently studying both <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Kelly_(astronaut)">Scott Kelly</span> and his identical twin <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly">Mark</span>, who unlike his brother spent <span class="entity DA" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Date, duration, time period">this past year</span> on <span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span><span class="text right">, to better understand these physiological changes.</span><br />
<span class="text left">So if you do wish you were slightly taller, consider becoming an astronaut who participates in long term space missions. But remember to relish your extended height when you’re up there, because once you get back down to </span><span class="entity AE" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</span><span class="text right"> it’s all going to shrink.</span>
